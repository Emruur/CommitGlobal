    "summary": "Hand washingThe first thing to remember and teach your child is to wash your hands often with soap. This should be done after visiting the toilet, after being on public transport, touching surfaces outside the house, including money, before cooking and eating, after contact with a pet, before carrying out any procedures for the care of yourself or your child.One person needs about 7.5 litres of water per day in times of crisis, if the person is mostly not in the shelter, but in the apartment/house: for body washing and washing, cooking, drinking and washing dishes. In the bomb shelter, the need decreases depending on the storage capacity and the availability of ready-to-eat food: 1.5 litres of drinking water and 0.5-1 litres of technical water for hygiene per person.",
