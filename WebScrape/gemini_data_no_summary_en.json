      "bResponse": "To continue your studies in Romania, go directly to the desired university.  Enrollment is possible even without complete documentation, using a self-declaration of prior studies, though university-specific evaluation processes apply.  Before completing your studies, you must provide Romanian higher education institutions with diplomas granting access to your enrolled study cycle.  For diploma equivalence, contact the National Center for Diploma Recognition and Equivalence (CNRED)  to equate your existing diplomas, necessary for further study enrollment.  If you've completed your studies, CNRED evaluates and recognizes study documents for further studies or labor market access.  To obtain a recognition certificate, submit a file including an application (physical submission only), diploma/certificate copies (translated if not in Romanian, English, French, Spanish, or Italian), school records, ID, and a 100 RON fee (except for those with international protection). Documents may require apostille or superlegalization. File submission is online (through the Electronic Single Point of Contact), at the university, or at the Ministry of Education's Registry.  CNRED will respond within 30 working days, with extensions possible.  Certificates are obtained electronically, from the university, or CNRED.  Appeals against CNRED decisions are submitted to the Ministry of Education's registry within 45 working days. For more details, visit https://dopomoha.ro/en/education",
