The length and organization of the school year can determine how well students engage with their studies and maintain regular attendance throughout the academic year. For instance, shorter breaks between school terms may encourage students to attend classes more frequently as they strive to catch up after each break period. Additionally, having fewer holidays during the school year might help improve overall student attendance rates since there would be less time for absences due to personal matters such as family vacations or illness. However, it is important to note that different factors come into play when considering these aspects; therefore, no single factor determines whether a particular structure will positively or negatively influence student attendance and academic performance.
